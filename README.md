# Side_Projects
Just quick/side projects and codes made for my own practice.
These are some of my projects I've tried.
<br>These pushes are just to document my progress. ^_^

<br>
* **Prime Numbers**. <br>Using a class to find and verify (prime) numbers. A little extra is to also find the nth (input) prime number.
<br> I did also try to improve the program by calculating and saving found prime numbers into a txt file such that the time complexity to get the prime numbers again is O(1) instead. Though this comes with a cost of extra memory used. (Note I did consider sieve of Eratosthenes, but I opted to not go for that).

<br><br>
* **Array Sorting and Searching**. <br>Just a collation of some sorting and searching algos I know of. All of them are in-place sortings. 

<br><br>
* **Birthday Bot**. <br>Developed a bot to send timely birthday wishes to my friends and family via mail, and to remind me of their birthdays too. This is used in tandem with Windows task scheduler to run this script every day and check for any birthdays.
